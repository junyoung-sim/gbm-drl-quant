# Geometric Brownian Motion and Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Low-Frequency Trading

This AI trading model consists of two major components:

    (1) Geometric Brownian Motion for price simulation and short-term valuation cycle estimation

    (2) Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trading

## Geometric Brownian Motion for Estimating Short-Term Valuation Cycles

Geometric Brownian Motion is a stochastic process that models a randomly varying quantity following a Brownian Motion with drift. It is a popular stochastic method for simulating stock prices that follow a trend while experiencing a random walk.

Using the simulation shown above, we can estimate the probability that the value of a security would be greater than the current value. At every time ***t***, observe the security's historical data during the past N days and simulate M sample paths for the next K days from ***t***. This will yield a lognormal distribution of price values as shown in the second figure above. From that distribution of simulated prices, we may estimate the probability that the security's value would be greater than the current value during the K-day extrapolation period following ***t***. We may call this probability the valuation score of the asset of interest.

Repeat the same procedure for every ***t*** and we obtain the following output.

The graph on the top shows the valuation series of the S&P 500 obtained from the simulation on each day. Notice that the stock index reverses direction once the valuation score reaches a critical value and crosses 0.50!

## GBM + Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning = ?!

This trading model combines the aforementioned GBM simulation with Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trading (https://github.com/junyoung-sim/quant). Specifically, the trading model observes a multivariate state space (100-day look-back) that consists of the standardized valuation series of a stock of interest and four market-indicating securities (SPY, ^VIX, IEF, CL=F) obtained through the GBM simulations with an observation period of 60 days, an extrapolation period of 20 days, and 1000 sample paths. The trading model model also utilizes a discrete reward function and adaptive synchronization.

## Performance

The trading model was trained on the top 50 holdings of the S&P 500.
