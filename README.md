# Geometric Brownian Motion and Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Low-Frequency Trading

This AI trading model consists of two major components:

    (1) Geometric Brownian Motion for price simulation and short-term valuation cycle estimation

    (2) Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trading

## Geometric Brownian Motion for Estimating Short-Term Valuation Cycles

Geometric Brownian Motion is a stochastic process that models a randomly varying quantity following a Brownian motion with drift. It is a popular stochastic method for simulating stock prices that follow a trend while experiencing a random walk of up-and-downs characterizing risk. The following resources were used:

Using the simulation shown above, we can estimate the probability that the value of a security would be greater than the current value during the N-day period following the current value. At every time ***t***, observe the security's historical data during the past N days and simulate M sample paths for the next K days from ***t***. This will yield a lognormal distribution of price values as shown in the second figure above. From that distribution of simulated prices, we may estimate the probability that the security's value would be greater than the current value during the K-day extrapolation period following ***t***. Due to the principles of GBM, this probability ("valuation score") is impacted by the short-term mean return and variation in return (volatility or risk).

Repeat the same procedure for every ***t*** and we obtain the following output.

The graph on the top shows the "valuation series" of the S&P 500 obtained from the simulation on each day. Notice that the stock index reverses direction once the valuation score reaches a critical value and crosses 0.50!

## GBM + Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning = ?!

This trading model combines the aforementioned GBM simulation with Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trading (https://github.com/junyoung-sim/quant). Instead of observing the PAA-discretized and standardized price series of a stock and major market-indicating securities (SPY, IEF, EUR=X, GSG) as in the original research, the trading model observes a multivariate state space that consists of the standardized valuation series of the stock of interest and the four market-indicating securities obtained through the GBM simulations with an observation period of 100 days, an extrapolation period of 20 days, and 1000 sample paths.

The trading model was trained ***twice*** on the S&P 500 Top 50 holdings. Training the model multiple times benefits performance by providing the model with more experiences in observing many representations of each security's valuation series that slightly differ but are fundamentally equivalent due to the randomness involved in every GBM simulation.

Up-to-date testing is done on the Dow and Nasdaq indexes for simplicity.

| Metric | Benchmark | Model  |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| E(R)   | 0.1092    | 0.4766 |
| SD(R)  | 0.1596    | 0.4109 |
| SR     | 0.6960    | 1.1598 |
| MDD    | 0.5264    | 0.2391 |

The benchmark is the average performance of the Dow and Nasdaq indexes.

E(R) = annualized return, SD(R) = return standard deviation, SR = sharpe ratio, MDD = maximum drawdown

***The model's actions and performance may slightly vary within a reliable range due to the randomness involved in the valuation series generated by the GBM simulations.***
