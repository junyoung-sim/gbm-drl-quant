# Geometric Brownian Motion and Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Low-Frequency Trading

***IN PROGRESS***

This AI trading model consists of two major components:

    (1) Geometric Brownian Motion for price simulation and short-term valuation cycle estimation

    (2) Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trading

## Geometric Brownian Motion for Estimating Short-Term Valuation Cycles

Geometric Brownian Motion is a stochastic process that models a randomly varying quantity following a Brownian motion with drift. It is a popular stochastic method for simulating stock prices that follow a trend while experiencing a random walk of up-and-downs characterizing risk. The following resources were used:

Using the simulation shown above, we can estimate the probability that the value of a security would be greater than the current value during the N-day period following the current value. At every time ***t***, observe the security's historical data during the past (100) days and simulate (100) sample paths for the next (50) days from ***t***. This will yield a lognormal distribution of price values as shown in the second figure above. From that distribution of simulated prices, we may estimate the probability that the security's value would be greater than the current value during the (50)-day period following ***t***. Due to the principles of GBM, this probability ("valuation score") is impacted by the short-term mean return and variation in return (volatility or risk).

Repeat the same procedure for every ***t*** and we obtain the following output.

The graph on the top shows the valuation scores estimated through the simulation each day for the S&P 500. Notice that those probabilities appear to be leading indicators; once the probabilities reach a significant value (below 0.30 and above 0.80), the stock index reverses direction!

## GBM + Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning = ?!

This trading model combines the aforementioned GBM simulation with Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trading (https://github.com/junyoung-sim/quant). Specifically, along with the PAA-discretized and standardized multivariate state space consisting of the historical data of a stock of interest and major market-indicating securities (SPY, IEF, EUR=X, GSG), the trading model also observes the valuation score of the stock of interest and the four market-indicating securities as a measure of significance in recent market movements and a mean-reversion indicator.

The trading model was trained on the S&P 500 Top 100 holdings. 90% of the historical data was allocated for training. The remaining 10% was used for out-of-sample testing.

The following figure shows an example of the trading model's training performance (JPM).

The following figure shows an example of the trading model's out-of-sample performance after training (JPM).



The following table summarizes and compares the trading model's out-of-sample performance to that of the buy-and-hold benchmark.

| Metric | Benchmark | Model  |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| E(R)   | 0.0000    | 0.0000 |
| SD(R)  | 0.0000    | 0.0000 |
| SR     | 0.0000    | 0.0000 |
| MDD    | 0.0000    | 0.0000 |

E(R) = annualized return, SD(R) = return standard deviation, SR = sharpe ratio, MDD = maximum drawdown

The following figure shows an example of up-to-date model performance ().
